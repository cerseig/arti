      "description" : "Westworld splits its time between various parts of futuristic theme park called Delos where guests get to live in recreations of three different time periods: the old west, medieval Europe, and ancient Pompeii. The three words are populated with androids the guests can fight and have sex with, all without the pesky morals that might come up if there were “real” people involved.\n \n In the movie, a virus begins spreading through the androids. A female android refuses a guest’s “advances” and a knight doesn’t let the guest win their sword fight.\n",

      "description" : "Summer Wars presents us with two different settings and conflicts. Oz, an internet-based society in which tens of millions of people and businesses around the world, represented by their own custom avatars can interact with each other in all manner of activities. The other contrasting setting is an old-style Japanese mansion in a calm countryside area. In the movie Oz is hacked by an intelligent machine, stealing people’s account.\n \nIs the movie trying to warn us from technology becoming so ingrained in our lives?\n",

      "description" : "Computers have bodies different from ours. But they still can give the appearance of having emotions. R2D2 doesn’t have a humanoid body, far from it, but the fact that he expresses himself with “facial” display or cute noises makes him endearing. Thus, the issue is not one of the body, or of the body’s capabilities to express, but the issue is a much harder one: how to get machines to express emotion in an appropriate way? ",

It is used by the \"Blade Runners\", policemen in charge of the withdrawal of the illegal replicants, to determine if an individual is a replicant or a human being. This device measures biological responses to stimuli to assess the replicators' potential for empathy. Their eyes shine when they are troubled.",

      "description" : "A fully autonomous, conscious, decision-making humanoid bot is, at the moment, the stuff of fiction. And yet, ‘affective computing’, or the capability to recognize, respond to and even emulate human emotions is present in some of today’s machines. So to what extent can machines exhibit emotional intelligence? And how are these capabilities being put to use?",
