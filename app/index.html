                <h1>Affective computing</h1>
                <p>Affective computing (also called "Artificial emotional intelligence") can be divided into 3 main
                    topics, which are: display, identification and synthesis. For an IA to interact naturally with a
                    user, it is obligate to go through these 3 phases. IEA (Artificial Emotional Intelligence) brings
                    together various fields of research such as information, psychology and cognitive science (study of
                    interactions between technologies and feelings).</p>

                <h1>Why was it invented ?</h1>
                <p>According to studies, current technologies would be very far from being able to satisfy the
                    population. Technologists have ignored the emotions emanating from humans, creating frustrating
                    experiences for users. This consequence is due to a lack of understanding and a lack of measure of
                    the emotional. It was then that the experts decided to look into the issue and meet the needs of the
                    users.</p>

                <h1>Who manage it ?</h1>
                <p>The MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) Media Lab aims to develop new technologies / theories
                    that advance the understanding of the emotional and its role in the human experience. In order to
                    best meet the needs of humans, MIT seeks to strike a fair balance between emotion and cognition
                    (psychological activities related to knowledge) in the field of technology design. It must be
                    understood that emotion is in total opposition to cognition.</p>

                    <p>The Affective Computing, also called Artificial Emotional Intelligence is a vast topic  permanently evolving. This phenomenon, protagonist of the 21st century, is in constant evolution. The sources of our watch were inexhaustible, offering us every day new data, articles, inventions ...</p>
                    <p>This is how we decided to target this subject by relying on the cinema. The 7th art has proved its avant-garde. He constantly deals with affective computing, in many facets and for many years, especially in 1927 with Metropolis by Fritz Lang.</p>
                    <p>The filmmakers show the affective computing in different days. He can be seen as a nefarious and conspiratorial character such as Agent Smith in Matrix (Lena and Andy Wachowski, 1999). In another category, Affective Computing can be at the beginning docile before becoming counterproductive and destructive to the heroes. This case is supported by the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick, 1968) with the monotonous and icy robot Hal-9000. The third category explores the impact of man's dream and unconscious on the functioning of artificial intelligence. The latter can then become autonomous and humanize such as "the child machine" in A.I. Artificial Intelligence (Steven Spielberg, 2001). Finally, the CA can be a support, a help to the man. R2D2 (Star Wars A New Hope, 1977 Georges Lucas) remains totally dedicated to its creator, fulfilling its status as a useful tool.</p>
                    <p>With today's inventions, we notice that reality has caught up with fiction. The examples of the cinema are currently under development or already exist. These 4 categories emit different assumptions for the future. Some support humanity, others go against or even destroy it. How far does Affective Computing get close to real emotions? Will there ever be a sentimental force powerful enough to be self-sufficient? We lie to ourselves trying to give "life" to objects? Is the intimacy of human beings in danger? Many questions that only the future will tell us.</p>
